# Indecision

Indecision is a React decision-making web app that helps you make decisions based of off your inputted options! Do you trust a computer to help you make a decision?

This is the first project created off of taking [The Complete React Web Developer Course (with Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/learn/v4/overview) on Udemy by Andrew Mead. My commits show my progress as I finish lectures, try challenges, and learn! At the time of this update, I have completed ~50 lectures. The course has 188 lectures and 36 hours of videos.
