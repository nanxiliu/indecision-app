This is the first project created off of taking [The Complete React Web Developer Course (with Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/learn/v4/overview) on Udemy by Andrew Mead. My commits show my progress as I finish lectures, try challenges, and learn! At the time of this update, I have completed 73 lectures and finished the first application, and I will deploy the website in the near future. The entire course has 188 lectures and 36 hours of videos.
